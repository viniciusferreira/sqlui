	Feel free to use these scripts how to give in the tile!!!


#### 1. FOREWORD

 The SQLui was created to facilitate the work of developers working with JSON files.
 The sqlui.class.php class can be used in any script in PHP to faciliar creating and manipulating JSON data files.
 SQLui is an alternative for developers who do not want to use a conventional base or NoSQL data.

 One minimal of knowledge about PHP, SQL and JSON is expected to interpret this manual. 


#### 2. GETTING STARTED

 All SQL statements must be written in capital letters.
 All references to fields and tables must be carried out with lower case letters.
 All records should be treated as strings.
 There should be no line breaks in query.

 The command will always return an array containing the key and the records, how to you can see in the example below.

>Query:

```sql
	SELECT * FROM test
```	
	
>Return:

```php
	Array(
		[0] => Array(
				[field_name] => value
				[field_name] => value
				...
			)							
		[1] => Array(
				[field_name] => value
				[field_name] => value
				...
			)							
		)
```	
The class yet can return arrays with 'notice' or 'error' in the case of failures.

>Query:

```sql
  CREATE TABLE users
```

>Return:

```php
	Array(
		[error] => Array(
			[0] => Table users already exists
		)
	)
```

or

>Query:

```sql
	CREATE TABLE test
```

>Return:

```php
	Array(
		[notice] => Array(
			[0] => Command Successfully
		)
	)
```	

#### 3. HOW TO DO?

By placing the files on the server and run the first access, you will automatically create a directory "database" with JSON files "users.json" and "levels.json".

You must configure the permissions of access to server files to maintain content integrity.

If you want to change or enter a new user the password, field password must be encrypted as follows below:

```sql
  UPDATE users SET password=PASSWROD('your password') WHERE id='0'
```

or

```sql
  INSERT INTO users VALUES('id','name',PASSWROD('your password'))
```

After initial setup you can use the system via the web interface, posting commands directly into the bar, or load the class in your PHP script.

To load the class add this command below.
 
```php
	$sqlui=false;
	if (!$sqlui) $sqlui = new SQLui();
	$sqlui->Connect('your_user','your_password');
	$sqlui->Database('your_database');
```

The Database method is optional , you can use TAKE command to select or change a database used.

```php
	$sqlui=false;
	if (!$sqlui) $sqlui = new SQLui();
	$sqlui->Connect('your_user','your_password');
	$sqlui->Command('TAKE database_name');
```

Default user and password are respectively 'root' and 'pass'.
All user validations will be made in databases/sqlui/users.json, so, to add or remove access to the system, manipulate this table.

```php
	$command=$sqlui->Command("UPDATE users SET password=PASSWROD('Your new password') WHERE id='0'");
```		
		
Return:

```php
	$command=Array(
		[notice] => Array(
			[0] => Command Successfully
		)
	)
```

And to read the records:

```php
	foreach($command as $value){
		echo $value[col_name];
	}
```

And this print

```php
	Command Successfully
```

#### 4. DEFINITIONS, STATEMENTS AND SYNTAX

 Commands in brackets are optional.
 The items inside braces are required.
 All posted values should be treated as strings between single or double quotes.


>###### 4.1. SHOW Syntax

```	
Example:

 Delete a table.
 
	DROP TABLE {tbl_name}

 Example
 
	Query:
		DROP TABLE test
	
	Return: 
		Array(
			[notice] => Array(
				[0] => Command Successfully
			)
		)
	


###### ALTER TABLE Syntax

 Changes a table structure.
 
	ALTER TABLE {tbl_name}
		{ADD|DROP col_name[col_name...]}|{CHANGE col_name new_name[,col_name new_name...]}

 Example
 
	Query:
		ALTER TABLE test ADD field

	Return: 
		Array(
			[notice] => Array(
				[0] => Command Successfully
			)
		)
	


###### TRUNCATE Syntax

 Truncate a table.

	TRUNCATE {tbl_name}

 Example

	Query:
		TRUNCATE test
	
	Return: 
		Array(
			[notice] => Array(
				[0] => Command Successfully

		)
	


###### SELECT Syntax

 Select the contents of a table. 
	
	SELECT [DISTINCT] [COUNT] {tbl_name.col_name|col_name|*}
		FROM {tbl_name} [[LEFT]JOIN {join_tbl_name} ON {where_condition}]
			[WHERE {where_condition}]
				[ORDER BY {col_name}[ASC | DESC]]
				[LIMIT {[offset,]row_count}]
				[INTO 'file_name']
				

 Example

	Query:
		SELECT tbl1.col,tbl2.col FROM tbl1 JOIN tbl2 ON tbl2.col=tbl1.col LIMIT 2
	
	Return:
		Array(
			[0] => Array(

				[count] => 1
			)
		)
	


###### WHERE Syntax

 Used to filter records. 
	
	WHERE {tbl_name.col_name|col_name}{operator}{'string'}
		[{AND|OR} {tbl_name.col_name|col_name}{operator}{'string'}...]
	

 Where operators are.
 
  Operator  | Result
	--------- | -----------------------
	=         |	equal
	<>    	  |	not equal
	!=	      |	not equal

 Example

	Query:
		SELECT col FROM tbl WHERE col='needle'
			
	Return: 
		Array(
			[0] => Array (
				[col] => needle
			)
			[1] => Array (
				[col] => needle
			)
		)
		


###### LIKE Syntax

 Used to filter records using a pattern. 
	
	[NOT] LIKE {'[operator]string[operator]'}		

 Where, operators are a signal %, and can be used this way. 
 
  Operator  | Find word
  ----------|---------------
	'string%'	|	starting with
	'%string'	|	ends
	'%string%'|	contains

 Example

	Query:
	 SELECT col FROM tbl WHERE col LIKE 'ne%'

		INSERT INTO tbl(id,name) VALUES('0','name 0')
	
	Return:
		Array(
			[notice] => Array (
				[0] => Command Successfully
			)
		)	

 When you insert more than one record, use this syntax to make the process faster.
 
	Query:
		INSERT INTO tbl VALUES('0','name 0'),('1','name 1'),('2','name 2')
	
	Return: 
		Array(
			[notice] => Array (
				[0] => Command Successfully

			[notice] => Array (
				[0] => Command Successfully
			)
		)
	


###### DELETE Syntax
